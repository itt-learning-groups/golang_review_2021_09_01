# Golang Review for Sept 1, 2021

## Summary

* We covered the "resultsCollector" example as a "class" exercise. Here's a link to the file we worked on during the exercise: <https://github.com/itt-learning-groups/golang_review_2021_09_01/blob/main/resultsCollector.go>
* We discussed the timing and content of the switch-over from Golang Review to Learn&Kount/DevOps: Kingsuk will send out a message announcing the 1st Learn&Kount/DevOps meeting on Sept 29. Once US Learn&DevOps is over, probably at end of October, we will likely switch Learn&Kount/DevOps to a weekly cadence with 60-minute meetings. Here's a link to the working draft of the (tentative) topic list: <https://github.com/itt-learning-groups/golang_review_2021_09_01/blob/main/Learn_and_Kount_DevOps_Draft_Topic_List.md>
